        The problem of excessive greenhouse gas emission brings up one of the UN Sustainability goals which is Clean and Renewable Energy. As I mentioned before greenhouse gasses are a huge problem and clean and renewable energy is a great solution. Im focusing on the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. The global energy mix is the the combination of the various primary energy sources used to meet energy needs. It includes fossil fuels such as, oil, natural gas and coal , nuclear energy , non-renewable waste and the many sources of renewable energy like wood, biofuel , hydro, wind, solar, geothermal , heat from heat pumps, renewable waste and biogas. The UN goal is to increase significantly the percentage of renewable sources in the energy mix.
